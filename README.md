## Description üìù
PiCompliance is a network scanning and security analysis tool. It leverages `nmap` for host discovery and port scanning, identifies device types (PC, Phone, Other), and checks for potential security issues such as open ports, default passwords, and vulnerable services. The frontend is built with Angular, providing a user interface to view scan results and device details.

## Features ‚ú®
*   **Network Scanning**: Discovers hosts on a network using `nmap`.
*   **Device Identification**: Categorizes devices as PCs, phones, or others based on hostname, OS, and open ports.
*   **Security Analysis**: Identifies potential security issues, including open ports, risky services, and default passwords.
*   **Vulnerability Detection:** Detects services and possible vulnerabilities.
*   **Web Interface**: Angular-based frontend for visualizing scan results.
*   **API Endpoints**: FastAPI backend provides API endpoints for accessing scan data.



## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è
*   **Backend**: Python, FastAPI
*   **Frontend**: Angular, TypeScript, Bootstrap
*   **Scanning**: `nmap`
*   **Reporting**: reportlab



## Installation üíª
1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kerolly/PiCompliance.git
    cd PiCompliance
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```



## Usage üöÄ
1.  **Start the backend server:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    python main.py
    ```

    This will start the FastAPI server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2.  **Start the frontend development server:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ng serve
    ```

    This will start the Angular development server, typically on `http://localhost:4200/`.

3.  **Access the application**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` (or the appropriate address if the frontend server is running on a different port).



## How to use ‚öôÔ∏è
1.  In IDE, run the pi_sripts/main.py, to initiate the network scan
1.  Navigate to the main page in frontend.
2.  Click the `Scan` button to get the data from backend.
3.  View the discovered devices categorized as PC, Phone, or Other.
4.  Click on a device category to view detailed information, including IP address, MAC address, open ports, and security analysis.


## API Reference ‚öôÔ∏è
The backend provides the following API endpoints:

*   `GET /pc`: Returns a list of identified PCs.
*   `GET /phone`: Returns a list of identified phones.
*   `GET /others`: Returns a list of other devices.
*   `GET /all-categorized`: Returns a list of all devices with their categories.



## License ‚öñÔ∏è
